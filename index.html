                    Your water heater is one of the essential appliances in your home. It provides hot water for bathing and cleaning and is vital in keeping your home comfortable and energy efficient. That’s why it’s essential to take care of your water heater and ensure it’s running correctly. Here are four tips to help you do just that.

                    1. Check the Temperature Setting
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of the most important things you can do to care for your <a href="https://freeair.ca/water-heaters-milton/">water heater</a> is to check the temperature setting. Most experts recommend setting your water heater between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. This will help prevent scalding while providing enough hot water for your needs. You can check your water heater’s temperature by looking at the thermostat on the front of the unit. You may need to contact a professional for assistance if you don’t see a thermostat or can’t reach it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a gas water heater, you’ll also need to periodically check the pressure relief valve. This valve is designed to release pressure if the water in the tank gets too hot. You can test the pressure relief valve by lifting the handle and allowing water to flow out of the valve. It must be replaced if water leaks or the valve doesn’t close properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electric water heaters may have a reset button on the thermostat. This button is designed to shut off the power to the unit if it overheats. If your electric water heater trips the circuit breaker, you must press the reset button to restart it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s also essential to flush your water heater periodically to remove any sediment that has built up in the tank. Sediment can cause your water heater to work less efficiently and even shorten its lifespan. You can flush your water heater by attaching a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the unit and running the hose until clear water comes out.
                </p>

                            2. Flush the Tank Regularly
                        </h2>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            Another essential maintenance tip is to flush your water heater’s tank regularly. This helps to remove sediment that can build up over time and cause problems with your water heater. Most manufacturers recommend flushing your water heater once a year. If you have hard water, you may need to flush more often.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To flush your water heater, turn off the power to the unit and shut off the water supply. Attach a garden hose to the drain valve at the bottom of the tank and open the valve to let the water drain out. Once the water has drained, close the valve and turn on the water supply. Turn on the power to the unit and let it fill up. Once it’s complete, turn off the power and let the unit sit for a few minutes before turning it back on. This will help remove any air that may be in the tank.

                            Part of your water heater’s tank is coated with a metal called an anode rod. This rod helps to protect the tank from corrosion. Over time, the anode rod will rust and need to be replaced. You should inspect your anode rod at least once a year and replace it if necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have a water heater with an anode rod, it’s essential to inspect it regularly and replace it when necessary. An anode rod is a metal rod that helps protect your water heater tank from corrosion. Only storage tank/tanked water heaters will have an anode rod, so you can skip this step if you have a tankless water heater.

                    4. Know When to Call a Professional
                </h2>
                <hr><br>
                <p>
                    Even if you take good care of your water heater, there will come a time when you need to call in a professional for help. If you notice any strange noises coming from your water heater or if it starts to leak, it’s time to call a plumber. These are signs that your water heater needs repair or replacement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you’re unsure whether your water heater needs repair, it’s always best to call in a professional. A licensed plumber can assess the situation and let you know what needs to be done. In some cases, a simple repair will suffice. However, if your water heater leaks or makes strange noises, it will likely need to be replaced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes time to replace your water heater, there are a few things to remember. First, you’ll need to decide what type of water heater you want. There are two main types: tankless and storage tanks. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand, so they’re more energy-efficient than a storage-tank water heater. However, they’re also more expensive upfront. Storage tank water heaters are less expensive upfront but use more energy to keep the water hot. You’ll also look at fuel type; electric, gas, or solar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you’ve decided on a type of water heater, you’ll need to choose a size. Water heaters come in various sizes, so it’s essential to choose one that’s large enough to meet your needs but not so large that it wastes energy.
